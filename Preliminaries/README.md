# Preliminaries

All machine learning is concerned with extracting information from data.

## Datasets & Linear algebra

Moreover, machine learning typically requires working with large datasets, 
which we can think of as tables, where the rows correspond to examples and the columns correspond to attributes. 

Linear algebra gives us a powerful set of techniques for working with tabular data.

## Optimization & Calculus

**Additionally, deep learning is all about optimization.** 

We have a model with some parameters and we want to find those that fit our data the best. 

Determining which way to move each parameter at each step of an algorithm requires a little bit of calculus.

## Predictions & Probability

Next, machine learning is concerned with making predictions: what is the likely value of some unknown attribute, 
given the information that we observe? 

To reason rigorously under uncertainty we will need to invoke the language of probability.
